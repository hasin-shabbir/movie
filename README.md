# Project Name: Trapped.

# Project Description
The prompt selected was the first prompt that is built around a location. The main character, Ishmal, is confined to the limitations of her room bound by the 
psychological chains of her technological devices. The story unfolds as the location becomes her prison where she is trapped and her devices become her 
demons that haunt her. The story eventually folds off into a piece of horror and suspense where the very place Ishmal conveniently spends her daily life 
becomes her place of being trapped and a modern-day nightmare becomes a reality. The role of the place and the characters (even virtual) becomes significant to Ishmal's 
eventual realization of her needing to change her usual place and escape from her demons (devices) to escape being trapped.

<br/>
The focus of the story was on creating a horror thriller which revolved around the life of Ishmal who is so integrated in the technological world around her which 
consisted of her electronics that consisted of her voice controlled device, Alexa, her smartwatch, TV, etc. The other main character apart from ishmal herself is Alexa,
who even though is just a device but is shown to be significantly important through its representation in a demon form in Ishmal's nightmare. Alexa basically represents 
the main concept of the movie, which is how in this generation people are so immersed into their technological surroundings that these advancements in technology have 
started to somewhat gain control of the lives of these humans instead.

# Process
When we started with our initial meetings, we decided to move forth with a horror thriller theme, thinking in that direction. Following on, the scripts were changed
multiple times with different ideas floating in the room, but finally we came to a conclusion and wrote an elaborate script which we spent days shooting the scenes of 
the movie off campus. Even though we were not able to continue with this script of ours, we learned a lot through the days that we spent shooting off campus in regards 
to the importance of lighting, different camera angles, the resolution settings of the camera, the smooth transitioning of scenes, the techniques that required us 
to improvise the script on the spot, and editing the completed scenes as they were edited simultaneously to further understand the flow of the movie.
<br/>
<br/>
However, due to some circumstances that limited us from continuing our filming at the site off-campus, we had to come up in urgency with a backup plan with a motive 
that became our final project with the title 'TRAPPED'. Since we were originally thinking in the direction of horror and thriller, and had learned through our experiences
on how to go about it, we chose to stick with the same genre of the movie but had a restriction in confining the entire movie to a limited space that we could use in the
restriction of the time we had. Through the efforts of the entire team, we eventually concluded the script with an intellectually stimulating idea on how we are so dependent
on the use of technology in our lives that it has started to gain control of our lives, even if it may seem otherwise.
<br/>
<br/>
Considering the times of the pandemic and how each and every individual is entriely dependent on some technological device to carry their lives in one way or the other
we decided to go with this topic as regardless of any age limitation, it is applicable to all individuals. We wanted to remind the people to take some time off and actually 
go interact with people instead of these smart devices as the companions in these unprecedented times. 
<br/>
<br/>

Since our idea was to give the user an immersive experience, we decided to not introduce any interactivity within the movie itself, but instead integrate it through 
other factors in our website such as the 'Contact Us' form which was representative of a real life conversation that one may have with Alexa. As depicted in the movie multiple
times on how Ishmal commands 'Alexa' to mute/unmute the Television as well as switch on/off the lights, we have given that auhtority to the user on the website to have an analogous 
experience to that of Ishmal's on the website. This is represented by the 'Alexa' icon under the menu/NavBar which gives the user an option to change modes from dark to light
as well as mute and unmute the background music. The background music sets the tone for the website since as soon as the landing page of the website loads, the user is made aware
of the theme of the website through simply an auditory experience. When the website is accessed, the commandline text in the preloader informs the user about the technological
aspect of our theme and the text quotes 'click if you dare', represents the horror/suspense theme and excites the user to further thoroughly explore the website.

# Reflection/Evaluation
Through this experience, by the end of the project it is no doubt that the entire team seems to be comfortably skilled in the different aspects that brought our project 
together. From video editings, to editing sounds, to making animations, working on web developments, we have polished every aspect of it through the best of our capabilities and
utilized this time to facilitate ourselves with the learning opportunity that it provided us with. Through teamwork, we have also understood the various aspects of different 
platforms from each other as well which includes sharing the knowledge of features such as responsive web design, javascript implementation, and learning the usage of Adobe 
Premiere Pro. We have also learned on how to better collaborate and communicate, as well as collectively improvise to come up with a production in so little time.
